The point was, to advance your career, you will need to manage people and climb the corporate ladder. You can only write so much code in a day, so your impact has an upper limit. Is this true?</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 590px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/a89639dd5393198de51d9607ddbbc69c/09ca4/scale.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 83.14763231197772%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Scale\"\n        title=\"scale\"\n        src=\"/static/a89639dd5393198de51d9607ddbbc69c/799d3/scale.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/a89639dd5393198de51d9607ddbbc69c/00d96/scale.png 148w,\n/static/a89639dd5393198de51d9607ddbbc69c/0b23c/scale.png 295w,\n/static/a89639dd5393198de51d9607ddbbc69c/799d3/scale.png 590w,\n/static/a89639dd5393198de51d9607ddbbc69c/09ca4/scale.png 718w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>In software development in particular, we think a lot about scale. We like our solutions to scale. It’s one of the holy grails of a great product. So we tend to tacitly assume that our careers must scale, too. Suggesting otherwise is like telling us our code is buggy: it’s counter to our intuition, and probably our ego. </p>\n<p>Somewhere in every dev’s consciousness is the mythology of the 10Xer: A great engineer can increase their team’s productivity by an order of magnitude or more. There’s exaggeration and truth in this.</p>\n<p>Yes, even great developers can only do so much in a day. Whether you work for a startup or a big company, you’re just one piece of a larger machine that can have many bottlenecks. And typically devs are viewed as a part of operating costs. They’re a necessary evil as far as the balance sheet is concerned. They don’t create revenue; they’re just needed to help the business deliver on its commitments.</p>\n<p>But bad development and management decisions can certainly cause a project to advance 10 times slower. In software, where complexities multiply at every turn, clarity is golden. And that comes from experience.</p>\n<p>Today more than ever, it’s possible to have an outsized impact. For one thing, consider the power of online content. A great developer can evangelize and build community around a technology by giving talks, creating content and interacting on social media.</p>\n<p>Also, in this age of digital transformation and heightened consumer expectations, technology architecture is becoming more enmeshed with business decisions. Retailers, construction companies and mom-and-pop shops alike must take their stack seriously just to provide an adequate experience for their customers, let alone get a competitive edge. If <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/en-gb/2018/11/07/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-fuelling-tech-intensity-in-the-uk/\">“every company is a software company,”</a> even the suits need to be technical.</p>\n<p>So personally, I don’t worry about not scaling. I try to have faith that if I keep learning and building stuff, good things will happen. Software (and, uh, life?) is magical like that.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Do you scale?","date":"June 12, 2019","description":null,"devUrl":null,"twitterUrl":"https://twitter.com/LucasWonderley/status/1138673163464794112"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/do-you-scale/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/dont-be-arrogant/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Don’t be arrogant.
