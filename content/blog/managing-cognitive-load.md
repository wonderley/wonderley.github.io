How not to turn into a computer when you work on one all day

Doing challenging technical work can starve your social and creative sides because it forces you to strive for correctness all the time. You have to take deliberate steps to maintain a sense of balance, well-being and humanity.

I find joy in the abstraction, logic and ingenuity that software development entails. But the work can take a toll.

To debug effectively, you have to think like a computer and play out how a system works in your head. Do this for many hours every day, and you may begin to feel like a computer yourself.

Our work affects us more than we realize. And I don't want to permanently lose touch with the other parts of myself. This has led me to seriously consider leaving engineering entirely.

But the underlying problem of getting sucked into technical work at the expense of other parts of one's life and personality isn't a sad reality to be accepted. The issue can be avoided. I've found that the key is managing cognitive load.

Put another way, you’ve got to avoid overworking your brain’s RAM. Following a few guidelines makes a huge difference.

Find time throughout the day to do things you love but which aren’t highly analytical. Know what these things are and set concrete goals for them so the time you spend on them doesn’t feel wasted. These activities can keep you sane and balanced.

You can do something as simple as going for a walk. Anything physical is a great start. You want to keep blood flowing in your body, not just your head.

Also, creative and analytical tasks use different mental muscles. Take advantage of this distinction by taking creative breaks to rest your analytical chops.

Seek out conversations about something other than that problem you’re solving. A simple chat can be a fun way of remembering that not everything needs to fit into a perfectly logical box.

I like listening to podcasts in a language I’m learning to get some extra low-effort exposure. This isn’t for everyone, but you can probably think of something similar that applies to your interests and experience.

Finally, use a system of notes to record your thoughts and ideas in digital or paper form. Make lists, jot down TODOs, and draw pictures. By writing down what you’ve already figured out, you give your mind more space. This keeps it from getting bogged down.

It is possible to do technical work without feeling like it's turning you into a robot. Coding doesn't have to be antithetical to being social. You can embrace being a nerd, be successful in your career and still be a real human being in the rest of your life. It just requires self-awareness and being disciplined with your time.

Churchill — having a hobby — Maybe this is why Churchill insisted so much on the importance of having a hobby separate from your main work (I can't include this because it's another reference to Perell/Forte. This should tell me that I need to diversivy my consumption.)
